>Alfred Search Workflow for Laracasts.com.

I was so inspired by [Laravel Docs Workflow for Alfred](https://github.com/tillkruss/alfred-laravel-docs) and [VueJS Docs Workflow for Alfred](https://github.com/vmitchell85/alfred-vuejs-docs) that I wanted to create a little workflow for my favorite website : **[Laracasts.com](https://laracasts.com)**.

## How it works:
