>Alfred Search Workflow for Laracasts.com.

I was inspired by [Laravel Docs Workflow for Alfred](https://github.com/tillkruss/alfred-laravel-docs) and [VueJS Docs Workflow for Alfred](https://github.com/vmitchell85/alfred-vuejs-docs) that I wanted to create a workflow for my favorite website : **Laracasts.com**.
